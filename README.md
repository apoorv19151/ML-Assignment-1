# Machine Learning Assignment-1

Major tasks performed in this assignment are-

* Used TSNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding) to reduce the dimensions of the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and visualize it using scatter plot.

* Implemented Linear Regression (Least Squares), Linear Regression with L1 regularization (LASSO) and L2 regularization (Ridge Regression) from scratch using gradient descent and used this implementation on the [Abalone Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/abalone).

* Used Logistic Regression (with and without regularization) from the sklearn library on the [UCI Ionosphere Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/ionosphere) and trained a model that predicted labels with an accuracy of 91%.

* Used PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce the dimensions of the MNIST dataset. Used OVO (One-vs-One) and OVR (One-vs-Rest) with Logistic Regression to predict the labels in MNIST dataset.

* Evaluated the performance of the above models using various techniques like precision, recall, AUC-ROC (implemented from scratch), accuracy and f1-score.
